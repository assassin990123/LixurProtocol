### Lixur is being re-written in Rust
Performance under Python was bad (16 transactions per second tops) and raised major performance issues, this utterly horrible performance could have also rooted from the fact that I didn't thread the transaction submission function, Recoding it in Rust nonetheless.

### What is Lixur ?
Welcome, we're glad to have you! Lixur is an open-sourced project building a distributed ledger platform. Lixur plans on implementing things such as DAGs and A.I smart contracts which enables fast, feeless, theoretically infinitely scalable, quantum resistant and an interconnected ecosystem with no-code SDKs, which users can make use of for any application requiring decentralized, automated intelligence and more. To learn more, please read the whitepaper [ üìñ Here üìñ](https://github.com/LixurProtocol/Lixur-Protocol/wiki/Lixur-Whitepaper-1.8.6)
